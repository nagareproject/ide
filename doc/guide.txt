Nagare Integrated Development Environment
=========================================

Nagare IDE is a pure Web Integrated Development Environment dedicated to the
Nagare Web framework.

It offers the browsing of your projects, the edition of the sources,
the debugging of the raised exceptions and the consultation in real-time of the
applications logs.

Installation
------------

Nagare IDE is a normal Nagare application that can simply be installed with:

.. code-block:: sh

  <NAGARE_HOME>/bin/easy_install nagare.ide

and then launched alongside with other applications:

.. code-block:: sh

  <NAGARE_HOME>/bin/nagare-admin serve --reload ide <app1> <app2> ...

It's recommanded to use the ``--reload`` option so that Nagare will be automatically
restarted when a source is modified in the integrated editor then saved.

.. warning::

   For obvious security reasons, only use Nagare IDE in a development environnement
   but **never in production**.

The IDE is then accessible at `http://localhost:8080/ide <http://localhost:8080/ide>`_:

Once installed, the IDE configuration file is located at
``<NAGARE_HOME>/lib/python<version>/site-packages/nagare.ide-<version>.egg/conf/ide.cfg``

Panels
------

The IDE follows a classical layout with a screen divised in 3 panels: the navigator,0
the editor and the logger panels.

Navigator
~~~~~~~~~

The navigator panel displays a tree of the currently launched applications and
their sources:

.. image:: img/navigator.jpg

Clicking on a filename opens it into the editor panel.
The ``Reload`` action forces a full reloading of the tree from the server. Useful
when files are added / removed on the filesystem, when new applications are launched
or when an exception no longer exists. During a reload, the already opened files
in the editor are kept open.

The available options in the ``[navigator]`` section of the configuration file are:

=================== ================== ================================================
Name                Default value      Description
=================== ================== ================================================
nagare_sources      off                Display the sources of the Nagare framework itself
allow_extensions    []                 Extensions of the files to display (set to ".py",
                                       ".js", ".css", ".html", ".txt" and ".cfg" in the
                                       default configuration file)
=================== ================== ================================================


Editor
~~~~~~

The editor panel provides direct edition of the sources:

tabsize             4             Number of space characters inserted for a tab
=================== ============= ================================================

Logger
~~~~~~

The logger panel receives in real-time, on a comet channel, the messages logged
by the applications:

.. image:: img/logger.jpg

By default, all the messages logged using the dedicated application logger, with
at least the `INFO` level, are sent to the IDE. The logging level can be changed
in the IDE configuration file. And, more generaly, to know how to use the logging
system of Nagare, see `The log service <http://www.nagare.org/core/log.html>`_

Debugging
---------

The simple fact of launching the ``ide`` application alongside to other
applications put these applicatons in debug mode where the IDE will catch their
exceptions.

.. note::

  The debug is not activated when the applications are launched by a
  multi-processes publisher (for example the ``fastcgi`` publisher).

When an exception occurs in an application, the IDE catches it and displays a
summary view:

.. image:: img/exception1.jpg

Also a full interactive exception is pushed in real-time to the IDE editor panel:

.. image:: img/exception2.jpg

Each frame of the exception can be expanded and a click on the  ``edit`` link open
a new editor tab, automatically set to the offending line ready to be fixed then
saved:

.. image:: img/exception3.jpg

An iteractive Python evaluator is also available in each frame:

.. image:: img/exception4.jpg

Security
--------

Out of the box, the Nagare IDE application creates a security manager to filter
the accesses based on their source IP address. By default only the connections
from ``127.0.0.1`` are accepted, other accesses being refused with a ``403 Forbidden
(Access was denied for this resource)`` error code.

It's possible to change the list of accepted IP addresses, or even to use a totally
different security manager in the ``[security]`` section of the configuration file:

=========== =================================== ================================================
Name        Default value                       Description
=========== =================================== ================================================
manager     nagare.ide.security:SecurityManager Reference to the security manager to instanciate
allow_hosts []                                  Set to ["127.0.0.1"] in the default configuration
                                                file
=========== =================================== ================================================
